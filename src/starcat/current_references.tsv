Includes derived discrete and continuous scores for predicting proliferation and antigen-specific activation (ASA), as well as discrete labels for T-cell lineage. See publication for details."

These include cell types (Microglia, Neutrophil, Macrophage, MonocyteC1Q, cDC) and other cell states (Immunosuppressive, Scavenger, Immunosuppressive, G2-M, IFN Response, IL1B, Inflammatory, G1-S, Hypoxia, CXCR4, Inflammatory, HS-UPR). See publication for details."

The publication describing these GEPs is in press at Nature Methods but the initial preprint describing the dataset is described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457678v1. Contained GEPs include the following: Dendritic cell, Ribosomal protein enriched, postnatal HSC, Erythrocyte, Megakaryocyte, Macrophage, fetal myeloid, basophil/mast cell, Lymphoid, cord blood, fetal HSC, Neutrophil, Erythroid. GEPs with two gene names separated by a ""/"" lack a clear interpretation and may represent dataset specific noise. "
